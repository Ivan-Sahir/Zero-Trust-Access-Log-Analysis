# Zero Trust Access Log Analysis

I made this project to simulate a SOC analyst task by analyzing Zero Trust access logs. 
I practiced working with access control data, visualizing trends, and detecting common access denial reasons using both LibreOffice and Splunk.


## Overview

- Analyzed realistic access logs in LibreOffice
- Identified top denial reasons and login patterns
- Ingested log file into Splunk
- Created dashboards to visualize behavior and access failures


# Tools Used
- LibreOffice Calc
- Splunk (Free Tier)
- Python â€“ to generate realistic .csv access logs
- Simulated CSV Logs


# What I Learned
- How to explore Zero Trust logs manually and in Splunk
